# This script sets up a Python 3 virtual environment in a directory .venv/
#   if it doesn't exist and installs all of the packages from
#   requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
#  into it.
#
#  In order for the backend sever to be set up properly you need to have Python 3.8.3
#   or higher installed and accessible as python3.
#
#  If you have this repo in a Dropbox, Google Drive, or some other online file syncing
#   service, after this setup you should move the .venv/ directory to somewhere else
#   and create a symoblic link to it here.
