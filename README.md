# Running data analysis project
The goal of this little project is to maintain my own database and analysis of my running, which I want to host on project's GitHub page.  I'd like for anyone to navigate to this project's page and see current summary information for my running activities, with some sort of interactive visualization.

  * update 3/30/2016: I'm going to start by making a little web app to display a heatmap of all my running waypoints.
    * First I'm going to make a simple heatmap, and then develop that into a live app that automatically gets updated as new activities get added.  My actvities are currently in a Dropbox folder that gets populated by the excellent [Tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com) app, which grabs them from Garmin Connect.  I might get ambitious and grab the activities from Garmin myself, but for now I'm just trying to get a javascript rendering of GIS points in a CSV file that is generated by [rundata.py](rundata.py)
